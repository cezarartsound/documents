fxload-usb is a simple tool to load firmware to a FX2LP device, using libusbx.
The firmware must be provided in intel hex format.

Prerequisites

In order to compile the loader, you need libusb installed, including the header files. In Ubuntu this would be the libusb-dev and libusb packages.

The rules file automatically loads the usb controller firmware on a system that uses UDEV to manage the devices (most modern linux distros do that).

To compile:
	make

To install:
	make install ("make DESTDIR=/some/where/ install" to install on a root different from /)

To uninstall:
	make uninstall (DESTDIR is also valid here)
