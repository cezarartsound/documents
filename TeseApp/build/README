To build just do:

After making, the build directory will contain the following binaries:
	itdsrc_daemon : daemon that must be running when a real board is connected
	to the system

	itdsrc_daemon_loopback: daemon that may be used to test the software without
	a real board and that emulates the behaviour of a board (not thoroughly
	tested)

	App: main program

All applications have a -h flag that may be used to call for help:
   ./App -h

An example setup, comprising of two boards is as follows:
        board 1 (RSU):
	   itdsrc_daemon (leave it running in the background)
		App -d 0 -p 50
	board 2 (OBU):
	   itdsrc_daemon (leave it running in the background)
		App -d 0
	
	In this setup, board 1 receives the speed from the sensors and sends it to
	the air, with device 0 as destination. Board 2, that has id 0, receives the
	frame and presents it in the screen.


Note that in all experiments, the used power was 50. Adapt to your needs. More
parameters are available on the obu and rsu. Adapt to your needs, allways
making shure that the options match between all the applications that are
running at any given time.
