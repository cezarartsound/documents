To build just do:
make

After making, the build directory will contain the following binaries:
	itdsrc_daemon : daemon that must be running when a real board is connected
	to the system

	itdsrc_daemon_loopback: daemon that may be used to test the software without
	a real board and that emulates the behaviour of a board (not thoroughly
	tested)

	itdsrc-obu: text application for the obu

	itdsrc-rsu: test application for the rsu that may be used when the srs
	devices are not available and that permits the manual introduction of a car
	speed to send

	srs-obu: graphical application that presents the received speed in the
	screen

	srs-rsu: application that integrates with the srs sensors and sends the
	detected speed when a car passes

All applications have a -h flag that may be used to call for help:
   itdsrc-obu -h

An example setup, comprising of two boards is as follows:
   board 1 (RSU):
	   itdsrc_daemon (leave it running in the background)
		srs-rsu -d 0 -p 50
	board 2 (OBU):
	   itdsrc_daemon (leave it running in the background)
		srs-obu -d 0
	
	In this setup, board 1 receives the speed from the sensors and sends it to
	the air, with device 0 as destination. Board 2, that has id 0, receives the
	frame and presents it in the screen.

If a third board was available, the following setup could be used:
   board 1 (RSU):
	   itdsrc_daemon (leave it running in the background)
		srs-rsu -d 0 -p 50
	board 2 (OBU 0):
	   itdsrc_daemon (leave it running in the background)
		srs-obu -d 0 -r 1 -p 50
	board 3 (OBU 1):
	   itdsrc_daemon (leave it running in the background)
		srs-obu -d 1

	In this setup, board 1 receives the speed from the sensors and sends it to
	the air, with device 0 as destination. Board 2, that has id 0, receives the
	frame, presents it in the screen and resends it, now with a device 1 as
	destination. Board 3, that has an id of 1, receives this frame and presents
	it in the screen.

Note that in all experiments, the used power was 50. Adapt to your needs. More
parameters are available on the obu and rsu. Adapt to your needs, allways
making shure that the options match between all the applications that are
running at any given time.
